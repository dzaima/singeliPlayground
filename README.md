# Singeli playground

![screenshot](https://github.com/dzaima/dzaima.github.io/blob/master/images/singeliPlayground.png)

Evalutes [Singeli](https://github.com/mlochbaum/Singeli) code in an interactive environment with viewable and modifiable vector variable watches.

### Usage
1. Clone [Singeli](https://github.com/mlochbaum/Singeli)
2. `./build.py`
3. `./run cbqn path/to/Singeli`

Code before `⍎` is top-level Singeli code. After `⍎`, the code will be placed inside an autogenerated function that reads & stores watches.

After `⍎`, you can use `name ← someValue` at the start of a line to create a watch of the value (which also defines `name` as a variable you can use). Once created, the type of a variable watch won't change, and so you'll need to remove it (click the "X") to regenerate it. Watches can be drag&drop reordered.

Assembly & IR tabs ignore all code after `⍎`.

Run with ctrl+s or ctrl+enter (or alt+enter or shift+enter).  
Assembly & IR tabs automatically recompile upon being switched to, but will require manual runs afterwards.

ctrl+plus/ctrl+minus to change interface scale.
